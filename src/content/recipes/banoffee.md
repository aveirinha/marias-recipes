## Ingredients

- 1 225g (approx) packet of plain chocolate digestive biscuits

- 1 tin of Carnation condensed milk caramel
- 300ml double cream
- 1 tsp Camp coffee
- 1 square of plain chocolate

## Method

1. Put the biscuits into a large bowl and bash them up into crumbs (alterntively, use a food processor to blitz them)
2. Heat the butter in a small pan over a medium heat until it is melted
3. Pour the melted butter over the biscuits and mix well
4. Using a metal spoon, press the biscuit mixture into a 20 to 23 cm loose-bottomed flan dish lined with baking paper
5. Put the biscuit base into the fridge to chill until it is set (approx an hour)
6. Cut the bananas into slices of about 0.5 cm and lay them on the chilled base to cover it as much as possible
7. Open the tin of caramel and spread it evenly over the banana slices. (It will help to stir the caramel first to make it softer and easier to spread)
8. Whip the double cream until it forms peaks
9. Add the Camp coffee to the cream, by forking it through so it just streaks the cream
10. Spread the cream over the caramel
11. Grate the square of chocolate over the top to decorate
