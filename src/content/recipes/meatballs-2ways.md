## Method

### Meatballs and Sauce

0. Preheat oven at 200 degrees.
1. In a large bowl, place both slices of bread and cover with the milk. Leave it until all the milk is absorbed.
2. Add both types of mince, diced onion, egg yolks, parsley, salt and pepper and mix very well.
3. Heat up olive oil in a large frying pan. Roll around 12-15 meatballs with your hands and gently fry them on all sides until browned.
4. Place the meatballs in a tray covered in foil and place them in the oven for 15 minutes.
5. Without washing the frying pan, add some more olive oil and the garlic. Fry it for 2 minutes.
6. Add the passata and 50ml of water and  the chopped basil and season well. Let it simmer until thickened.
7. Once the meatballs are cooked, add them back to the sauce and let it cook for 10 minutes.

### Pasta way

1. While the meatballs are finishing cooking in the sauce, bring some water to boil. Add olive oil and salt.
2. Cook the pasta following the package instructions.
3. Place the cooked pasta on a bowl. Add the meatballs on top of it.
4. Top up with as much sauce and grated cheese as desired.

### Meatball sub

0. Preheat the grill at 180 degrees
1. Cut the bread open and place it in a tray covered in foil. Drizzle some olive oil on the top half of the bread.
2. Spread some of the marinara sauce on the bottom half of the bread, place the meatballs carefully and add the cheese slices on top.
3. Place it under the grill for approximately 10 minutes. Check if more time is needed or the cheese has melted.

Enjoy!
