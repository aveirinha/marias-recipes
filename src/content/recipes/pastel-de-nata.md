Enough for 24 tarts!

## Ingredients

- 1L semi skimmed milk
- 3 lemon peels
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 200-300g caster sugar (depending on how sweet you like them)
- 100g plain flour
- 2 yolks
- 6-8 eggs (depending on size)
- 2 sheets of puff pastry

## Method

0. Preheat oven at 240 degrees (or the highest setting).
1. In a large saucepan, heat up the milk with the cinnamon sticks and lemon peels until it starts boiling. Remove from heat.
2. Mix the flour and sugar in a bowl and slowly add it to the sauce pan while stirring. Remove the cinnamon sticks and lemon peels and let the mix cool for 10-20 minutes.
3. With the pastry at room temperature, unroll the sheet and roll it again but horizontally. Cut the pastry in 3cm long cylinders.
4. Butter 2 muffin trays (for 24 tarts). Place the pastry cylinders vertically in each cup and with your thumbs press it down. Keep pressing around the bottom until the cup is covered.
5. Mix the eggs and yolks in a bowl and slowly add to the saucepan while stirring fast to avoid cooking the eggs.
6. Pour the mix into the individual cups until no more than half full.
7. Bake for 15 minutes (if the oven temperature is lower than 240, it will need ~10 minutes extra). Let it cool for 10 minutes and serve with cinnamon powder!
