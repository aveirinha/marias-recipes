Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Friends and money - oil and water. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone. When they come... they come at what you love. It's not personal. It's business.

Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. Never let anyone know what you are thinking. Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful? It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright?

Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English.
